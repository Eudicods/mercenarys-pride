Executive Officer's Log, Bennet's Badgers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capt Gardner somehow managed to get permission from the Raven Alliance for Bennet's Badgers to trial for the right to have our status as a mercenary command with 'known pirate ties' updated.
I do not know the details, but we have been given a time and place to show up and if we win, then we will be able to renew our contract with the militia.


Netherfield Commander's Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Today we will trial with Bennet's Badgers.
I anticipate a favorable outcome, but honor will not be served by me underbidding.
Also, Snow Raven leadership will not accept the outcome of the trial if Bennet's Badgers have too quick of a win.
I must disable as many of their 'Mechs as possible during the trial.


Scenario - Trial of Refusal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy and Capt Gardner have secured the chance for Bennet's Badgers to have a Trial of Refusal to reverse the classification of Bennet's Badgers as a mercenary command with 'known pirate ties'.
A successful trial outcome will result in the restoration of the Bennet's Badgers contract with the Jordan Wais militia for coming years.
