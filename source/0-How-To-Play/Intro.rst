Each month's scenarios can be played with either `Classic BattleTech <https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-total-warfare-pdf>`_ or `Alpha Strike <https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-alpha-strike-commanders-edition>`_.
Each scenario will specify the :ref:`characters<Characters>` to be used and provide scoring for objectives.
Your score at the end of the 15 scenarios will determine how closely your play through matches the lore of Mercenary's Pride.
