Executive Officer's Log, Bennet's Badgers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just got word that the Snow Ravens are transferring a Nova and supporting aerospace forces to Netherfield Military Park.
Everyone knows that when Ravens arrive, they are working an angle to further some ulterior motives.

Their official mission is assessing the readiness of the planetary militia and our support to their defenses, but that's a rather strange mission for a star of OmniMechs and a some toads.


Meryton Raid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pirate forces have been detected burning from a pirate point towards Jordan Wais.
Their destination is likely the planetary capital, Meryton.
Intercept the forces before they reach Meryton and repel them.

Game Setup
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Defender**

Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy, Star Commander Charles Bingley, Jane Bennet, and Elizabeth Bennet participate in this mission.
Additional members of Bennet's Badgers and Expeditionary Star Alpha may be included to reach the desired scenario size.
Bennet's Badgers and Expeditionary Star Alpha should field the same number of units and roughly the same BV (PV).

**Attacker**

Select an equivalent BV (PV) of `Pirates from the Master Unit List <http://masterunitlist.info/Era/FactionEraDetails?FactionId=38&EraId=257>`_ to match the defender's force.
This force may have at most 1 heavy BattleMech and may contain combat vehicles.


**Map**

Select 1 grasslands map for every 4 units in the scenario, rounded up.
Jordan Wais has thin atmosphere and 1,14 g.
Use the rules from *BattleTech: Tactical Operations Advanced Rules* for these conditions.

Objectives
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Track the BV destroyed by each side; the unit to land the final shot gets credit.
If Star Commander Charles Bingley and Jane Bennet both target a pirate unit before it is destroyed, then the BV for that unit counts for both sides, no matter which force destroys that unit.

Score Lore Points for the following accomplishments

* Snow Raven units destroy more BV than Bennet's Badgers (3 pts)
* Star Commander Charles Bingley and Jane Bennet both target the same unit (1 pt each)
* Elizabeth Bennet forces Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy to break Zellbrigen (3 pts)
* Named character dies (-3 pts)

Special Rules
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy will strictly adhere to Zellbrigen.
He will target the highest BV enemy 'Mech within range and continue firing exclusively upon that unit until it is destroyed.
Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy will only break Zellbrigen if Elizabeth Bennet targets the unit he is engaged with.

Star Commander Charles Bingley is the only Snow Raven warrior who will attack units currently targeted by Bennet's Badgers warriors.

The remaining Snow Raven warriors will prefer to shoot the same unit they shot the previous turn, unless another unit that is not engaged with a Bennet's Badgers unit offers better target numbers.

Bennet's Badgers will work together to destroy pirate units.
