Mountain Wolf Security Officer's Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Jane Bennet from Bennet's Badgers is visiting our Alpheratz factory.
We are conducting a product demonstration for her on our primary testing range in the hopes that a favorable review will encourage the militia on Jordan Wais to purchase more Merlin BattleMechs.

Note, Bennet's Badgers is a struggling mercenary command.
We should consider offering employment to its members at `Mountain Wolf BattleMechs <https://www.sarna.net/wiki/Mountain_Wolf_BattleMechs>`_ on the security team, as they are highly skilled MechWarriors.


Product Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Conduct training exercises with powered down lasers and dummy rounds.
