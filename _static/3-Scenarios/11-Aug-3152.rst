Netherfield Commander's Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have located Lydia Bennet before the Snow Raven Watch was able to.
George Wickham deserted the Jordan Wais militia and joined a pirate gang that has been raiding the Raven Alliance in this region.
It appears that George Wickham had planned this recent raid which resulted in his lancemates all dying.

If I capture George Wickham, he will likely be executed for treason.
Given the evidence, Lydia Bennet will likely also be executed if another Snow Raven warrior finds her before I can challenge these two in battle.


Scenario - Bondsmen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Star Captain Fitzwilliam Darcy has traced George Wickham, Lydia Bennet, and the pirates back to Halla.
The only way Star Captain Darcy can save Lydia Bennet from Outworlds and Snow Raven laws around pirates is to claim her as bondsman in combat.
Star Captain Darcy will claim George Wickham as a bondsman if possible, but his survival is not a priority.
