Executive Officer's Log, Bennet's Badgers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The planetary militia rotated back to Meryton last month.
We will be going on patrol with them this month.
Given the increased pirate activity we saw in October, we should be prepared for further conflict.

In other news, following the trials at Netherfield, the Snow Ravens have suddenly left for Alpheratz.
Jane was training with them extensively, but they gave no notice of their departure and left Jane arriving at Netherfield only to discover nobody there.
I am getting really tired of dealing with pretentious Snow Ravens.


Militia Commander's Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have relocated to Meryton following the recent pirate activity centered there.
Patrols have been doubled until we can locate the source of the pirate activity or the pirates move on.

Supervisor Wickham is the liaison to the local mercenary lance - Bennet's Badgers.
I was nervous when he joined the unit, as he washed out of the Snow Ravens warrior caste, but he proven to be better adapted to living among 'freebirths' than I anticipated.
